/*
"DEBUG" level: Debug messages contain contextual information. They are mostly
used for problem diagnosis.
Example: "I love having extra bacon for my 7XL-double-cheese-triple-pickle-specialketchup burger. I really do!"

• "INFO" level: These messages contain extensive information. They are helpful for
tracing program execution in a production environment.
Example: "I cannot believe adding extra bacon costs more money. You didn’t put
enough bacon in my burger! If you did, I wouldn’t be asking for more!"

• "WARNING" level: Warning messages indicate a potential issue in the system.
However, it can be handled or ignored.
Example: "I think I deserve to have some extra bacon for free. I’ve been coming for
years whereas you started working here since last month."

• "ERROR" level: These messages indicate an unrecoverable error has occurred.
This is usually a critical issue that requires manual intervention.
Example: "This is unacceptable! I want to speak to the manager now."
